										<p>This was a project I took on with other engineers from UCSD, where we were tasked with using a Jetson Nano to create a unique project. We believed with the coming of AI, we could create a motor vehicle that could read or hear words and locate and retreive the object in question all on a single board computer (SBC). But as many deep learning algorithms would need to run on the SBC, we needed a light algorithm that the Jetson Nano could handle. We decided that Efficient and Accurate Scene Text (EAST) detector and You Only Look Once (YOLO) model would be the best fit for our use case. So we recreated the models using OpenCV and Pytorch, trained the models for our use, and coded it together to make it work seamlessly.</p>
										<p>One part that aches me about this project is I had no knowledge of model pruning and reducing parameters to increase computation time, which would have significantly increased the computation time under load.</p>
