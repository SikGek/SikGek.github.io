										<p>I took on a project with one other engineering student to build a fully functioning pinball machine within 10 weeks. Many of the concepts were very new and foreign to us, so we had to prototype extremely quickly. We first built a custom pinball launcher using a metal rod, springs and 3D printed handle. Then the flippers were designed using a solenoid motor connected to a piston-like apparatus to punch up to  move the 3D printed flippers. For the point system, we used a seven segment display to show the scores, and several other sensors, such as a touch sensor to see when the ball runs over it, a laser sensor to detect when a ball goes through a certain space, for points and used a BLDC motor as an obstacle. Everything was put together on a frame made of laser cut wooden boards, completed with an auto ball collector at the bottom. Finally, everything was connected to an Arudino and a power supply, powering everything through a buck converter and breadboards. The entire system was coded in a non-blocking style format so everything could function simultaneously.</p>
